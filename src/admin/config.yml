    # Editors can create and edit photos, but not delete them
    # Contributors can only create new photos
    # Viewers can only view existing photos
    # Other users will not have access to the photo collection at all
    # Each role is defined as a separate object within the collection definition
    # Users can be assigned to roles using the Netlify Identity UI
